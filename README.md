### Hacktoberfest
All contributions are welcome! Here are some issues to get started on:
- [ ] [Make dark mode look better](https://github.com/aheze/ProgressGif/issues/6)
- [ ] [Display Gif size when export finishes](https://github.com/aheze/ProgressGif/issues/5)
- [ ] [Add haptic feedback when export finishes](https://github.com/aheze/ProgressGif/issues/4)

Steps:
1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes (just stick on the `main` branch)
3. For how to clone into Xcode, see <a href="#development">here</a>
4. Make a pull request
5. [Add yourself](https://github.com/aheze/ProgressGif/blob/main/ProgressGif/About/Contributors.swift) to the `Contributors` screen in the app!
```swift
let aheze = Contributor()
aheze.name = "Zheng"
aheze.additions = "199,405"
aheze.deletions = "29,470"
aheze.profileName = "ahezeProfile" /// name of your profile pic
aheze.linkImageName = "Medium"
if let profileURL = URL(string: "https://medium.com/@ahzzheng") {
    aheze.link = profileURL
}
contributors.append(aheze)
```

### App Store Download
Download ProgressGif on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1526969349). Because it's open-source, it's free!

### About
**For the writers and bloggers out there**

Tutorials with only words are boring, so we add images. And if they need to be more detailed, we add video... but video isn't always the best choice.
- Readers may not want to turn on audio
- If they're on their phone, the video will open in a full-screen modal, which disrupts the reading experience
- Some blogging sites don't allow video embeds

That's why we use GIFs instead! (Yes, GIFs are memory-inefficient, but they're really convenient, and ProgressGif has options for framerate)

ProgressGif is an iOS app made with Swift 5 and UIKit, inspired by this [article](https://www.excelcampus.com/tips-shortcuts/add-progress-bar-to-gif/). SwiftUI would have be fine for building the UI, but because there's a lot of under-the-hood work with video rendering, I thought it would be better to just go with UIKit.

### Features
ProgressGif does one thing only: Add progress bars to GIFs.

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Example 4 | Example 5 | Example 6 |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:|
| ![Example1] | ![Example2] | ![Example3] | ![Example4] | ![Example5] | ![Example6] |

Yeah, that's it. ProgressGif serves one purpose, and one purpose only... but in a highly customizable way! Customize height, bar color, bar background color, edge inset, corner radius… and shadows are in beta!

### Usage

| Step 1        | Step 2           | Step 3  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Import video      | Add the bar | Export |
| ![Step1] | ![Step2] |![Step3] |

### Contributing
Once again, all contributions are welcome! Here's some harder issues that I need help on:
- [x] Horizontal layout
- [ ] Allow picking colors with transparency
- [ ] Allow picking opaque color for background (so that shadows show up)
- [ ] Export as MOV instead of just GIF only

#### Development
1. Open Xcode's Welcome to Xcode screen (Window > Welcome to Xcode)
2. Click "Clone an existing project"
3. Enter the repository URL into the text field, then press "clone" (just stay on the `main` branch)
4. Open a terminal, and navigate to the project directory, where the `.xcodeproj` file is
5. If you haven't already, download [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) by typing in `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal
6. Type `pod install` to install the dependencies
7. Open the `.xcworkspace` file
8. Use the `.xcworkspace` file to write your code in

*ProgressGif is inspired by this awesome [article](https://www.excelcampus.com/tips-shortcuts/add-progress-bar-to-gif/).*
