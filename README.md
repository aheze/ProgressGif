### About
**For the writers and bloggers out there**

Tutorials with only words are boring, so we add images. And if they need to be more detailed, we add video... but video isn't always the best choice.
- Readers may not want to turn on audio
- If they're on their phone, the video will open in a full-screen modal, which disrupts the reading experience
- Some blogging sites don't allow video embeds

That's why we use GIFs instead! (Well yes, GIFs are memory-inefficient, but they're really convenient, and ProgressGif has options for framerate...)

ProgressGif is an iOS app made with Swift and UIKit, inspired by this [article](https://www.excelcampus.com/tips-shortcuts/add-progress-bar-to-gif/). 

**Why not SwiftUI?**

SwiftUI would have be fine for building the UI, but because there's a lot of under-the-hood work with video rendering, I thought it would be better to just go with UIKit.

### Features
ProgressGif does one thing only: Add progress bars to GIFs.

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Example 4 | Example 5 | Example 6 |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:|
| ![Example1] | ![Example2] | ![Example3] | ![Example4] | ![Example5] | ![Example6] |

Yeah, that's it. ProgressGif serves one purpose, and one purpose only... but in a highly customizable way. Customize height, bar color, bar background color, edge inset, corner radiusâ€¦ and shadows are in beta.

### Usage

| Step 1        | Step 2           | Step 3  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Import video      | Add the bar | Export |
| ![Step1] | ![Step2] |![Step3] |

### Contributing
All contributions are welcome. Here's some harder issues that I need help on:
- [x] Horizontal layout
- [ ] Allow picking colors with transparency
- [ ] Allow picking opaque color for background (so that shadows show up)
- [ ] Export as MOV instead of just GIF only

Steps:
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone into Xcode, see <a href="#development">here</a>
   1. Open Xcode's "Welcome to Xcode" screen (Window â†’ Welcome to Xcode)
   2. Click "Clone an existing project"
   3. Enter the repository URL into the text field, then press "clone" (just stay on the `main` branch)
   4. Open the terminal, and navigate to the project directory, where the `.xcodeproj` file is
   5. If you haven't already, download [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) by typing in `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal
   6. Type `pod install` to install the dependencies
   7. Open the `.xcworkspace` file
3. Make your changes (just stick on the `main` branch)
4. Make a pull request
5. [Add yourself](https://github.com/aheze/ProgressGif/blob/main/ProgressGif/About/Contributors.swift) to the `Contributors` screen in the app!
```swift
let aheze = Contributor()
aheze.name = "Zheng"
aheze.additions = 199405
aheze.deletions = 29470
aheze.profileName = "ahezeProfile" /// name of your profile pic
aheze.linkImageName = "Medium"
if let profileURL = URL(string: "https://aheze.medium.com/") {
    aheze.link = profileURL
}
contributors.append(aheze)
```
